    "summary": "Hi!\nI'm a Web Developer.\nI've been working for almost a decade as a Lead Developer on advanced Web Apps and APIs in PHP, mainly using the Symfony Framework. In order to maintain a high level of quality and maintenability, I have been collaborating regularly wih senior consultants and developers from SensioLabs (the creators of Symfony) and with some of their close business partners.\nI have been working as a freelance, as well as in a successful startup and now in an international industrial group.</p>I always advocate in my teams for best practices compliance as well as I keep in mind business' needs and features-delivery expectations üöÄ.\nI'm comfortable with frontend tooling as well (webpack, npm, yarn, sass, less...) and I'm familiar with ReactJS. I'm in charge of all the CI/CD process using Gitlab as well as the Linux web servers (our infrastructure was audited by a devops company in Paris and our CI/CD process was evaluated as excellent).\nI'm very interested by the Go language and I have been leveraging it in some personal projects.</p>I am open to similar positions but I am also ready for new adventures, wether it is on a different stack, or more devops-oriented or also for a managerial position.",

He found time to teach me more about php and routing when I was struggling to understand parts of our technological stack and to listen to me when I had a different opinion about the best way to develop a solution. \nI know he was doing the same thing for everyone on the team but still never missed a meeting nor an important deadline despite the complicated and often tough environment. \nThe team grew stronger thanks to him and I will happily work with him in the future if the opportunity presents itself."
