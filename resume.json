    "summary": "I have been developing advanced Web Apps and APIs in PHP and Javascript for over a decade, mainly using the Symfony framework. In order to maintain a high level of quality and maintainability, I have been collaborating regularly with senior consultants and developers from SensioLabs (the creators of Symfony) and with some of their close business partners.\nI have been working as a freelancer, as well as in a successful startup and now in an international industrial group.\nI always advocate for best practices compliance while focusing on business' needs and features-delivery expectations.\nI have a significant experience with frontend tooling (webpack, npm, yarn, sass, less...) and am familiar with ReactJS.\nIn my current position, I am in charge of the CI/CD process as well as the provisioning of Linux web servers. Our global infrastructure was audited by a devops company in Paris and our CI/CD process was rated as excellent.\nI am also very interested by the Go language and I have been leveraging it in some personal projects.\n\n This resume is maintained using the <a href=\"https://jsonresume.org\">JSON Resume</a> initiative for JSON-based standard for resumes. The Github repository with the JSON file and the code to generate the resume can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/philippecarle/resume\">here</a>. \nI am originally from France and emigrated to Canada at the end of 2018. I am a Permanent Resident.",

He found time to teach me more about php and routing when I was struggling to understand parts of our technological stack and to listen to me when I had a different opinion about the best way to develop a solution. \nI know he was doing the same thing for everyone on the team but still never missed a meeting nor an important deadline despite the complicated and often tough environment. \nThe team grew stronger thanks to him and I will happily work with him in the future if the opportunity presents itself."
